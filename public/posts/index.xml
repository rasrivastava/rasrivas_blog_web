      <description>LVM is a tool for logical volume management which includes allocating disks, striping, mirroring and resizing logical volumes.
With LVM, a hard drive or set of hard drives is allocated to one or more physical volumes. LVM physical volumes can be placed on other block devices which might span two or more disks.
The physical volumes are combined into logical volumes, with the exception of the /boot partition. The /boot partition cannot be on a logical volume group because the boot loader cannot read it.</description>

      <description>Disk Partitioning is the process of dividing a disk into one or more logical areas, often known as partitions, on which the user can work separately.
It is one step of disk formatting. If a partition is created, the disk will store the information about the location and size of partitions in the partition table.
With the partition table, each partition can appear to the operating system as a logical disk, and users can read and write data on those disks.</description>
